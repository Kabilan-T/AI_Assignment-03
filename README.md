### Implementation of Breadth First Search, Depth First Search and Iterative Deepening Depth First Search.
### Please read the PDF file in this repository to get an idea of the problem statement.

## Getting started
* Clone the repository by using the command,
```
git clone https://github.com/Kabilan-T/AI_Assignment-03.git
```

## Maps
* In src/maps directory, You will find three text files, each representing a map of the unsolved maze.
* The solved maze files are stored in src/results directory. you will find nine files (3 map x 3 algorithms) each representing a solved maze

## Execution
The traversal of the search agent through the map will be visible on the console. use the following commands after navigating to "src" directory.
* Breadth first search
```
python3 breadth_first_search.py
```
* Depth first search
```
python3 depth_first_search.py
```
* Iterative deepening depth first search
```
python3 iterative_deepening_search.py
```
